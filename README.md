# CountdownTimer-js
A countdown timer using Javascript.
This project was an opportunity to practice the setInterval and clearInterval functions.
New Date() and .getTime were needed to set the countdown date and capture the current date and time; the difference between the two was then worked out and displayed on the timer.
I also learnt about using String().padstart(x,y) to manipulate the look of my timer, always ensuring that where a single digit was displayed, the number would start with 0.
Designing the timer also allowed me to play with HTML and CSS and practice responsive design for different screen sizes.
